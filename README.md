#### The Controls on the left give you the power to move around the graph.
#### The ones on the right let you scale the graph up and down in both axis as much as you like.
#### The buttons in the center on left and right let you reset translation and scale respectively.
#### Drag the graph in whichever direction you like, then click the center button on the left to see the whole graph accelerate back to its original position!
## Just dive into the data! You get all the powers :)
